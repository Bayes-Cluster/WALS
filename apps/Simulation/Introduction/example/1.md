The method consisting of drawing random points within a square. Use the ratio of the number of points falling within the inscribed circle to the total number of points in the square to estimate $\pi$. 

$$\hat{\pi}=4 \times\frac{\text { number of points falling within the circle }}{\text { total number of points within the square }}$$
