Simulate a random sample from the distribution with density
$$f_X(x)=3 x^2, 0<x<1.$$
Solution: Here $F_X(x)=x^3$ for $0<x<1$, and $F_X^{-1}(u)=u^{1 / 3}$. Generate all $n$ required random uniform numbers as vector $u$. Then $u^{1 / 3}$ is a vector of length $\mathrm{n}$ containing the sample $x_1, \ldots, x_n$.
